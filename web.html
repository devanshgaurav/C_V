        <h1 class="ab_h">Website Development</h1>
        <p class="ab_p">Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products one is offering,
          understand why one's products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of the company's
           qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality images and thought-out
            presentation  will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to strive towards making your product as
            relatable and appealing as possible.Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet
            (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static
             page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.
           Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output,
            and encryption. It’s the work that happens behind the scenes.</p>
