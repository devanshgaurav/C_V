        <h1 class="ab_h">Machine Learning</h1>
        <p class="ab_p">A subset of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) is the area of computational
           science that focuses on analyzing and interpreting patterns and structures in data to enable learning,
           reasoning, and decision making outside of human interaction. Simply put, machine learning allows the
            user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make
            data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data. ML refers to an AI system that
             can self-learn based on the algorithm. Systems that get smarter and smarter over time without human
             intervention is ML. Deep Learning (DL) is a machine learning (ML) applied to large data sets. Most AI
              work involves ML because intelligent behaviour requires considerable knowledge.
           Deep Learning is basically mimicking the human brain, it can also be defined as a multi neural network architecture
            containing a large number of parameters and layers</p>

        <h4>Face Mask Detection</h4>
        <p>
            Build Sequential CNN model with various layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dropout and Dense.
            Fit images in the training set and the test set to our Sequential model we built using keras library.
            After building the model,label two probabilities for our results.
          We intend to use it to detect if we are wearing a face mask using our PC’s webcam. For this, first, we need to implement face detection.
          In this, I am using the Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers for detecting the features of the face.
        In the last step, we use the OpenCV library to run an infinite loop to use our web camera in which we detect the face using the Cascade Classifier.</p>

        <h4>Sentiment Analysis</h4>
        <p>Import the data and process the data to to make it usable for training for this we use tokenizer
         fit and text to Sequence function and we also convert the comment sentiment  to its dummy values. As our data set is not balance so we use
        resample to balance our dataset and then we  split the data in train and test. We create a Sequential model with certain
        layers first layer is embedding layer, then Lstm, Dense layer and int last we used softmax function and then compile the model using  categorical crossentrophy
        as loss function. Then we fit the model to our dataset and train our model. After training our model can predict the sentiment of out
      comment using the model.  </p>

        <h4>Blood Cell Analysis</h4>
        <p>Import and Analyse the data and as our dataset is already divided into test set and train set and validation set we store the path for every set.
        We use Image Data Generator to produce different manupulations of orignal data such as roated, shifted, scaled, zoomed, fliped and more.
        Image_gen.flow_from_directory is used to fit out Image_gen to train,test and validation data set.
        Using tensorflow keras models we build a Sequential model with certain layers Conv2D, MaxPooling2D,relu as Activation layer we use sigmoid as last layer
      And compile our model with binary crossentrophy as loss function.After training our model with help of fit_generator, test it against our test set and check for efficiency.   </p>

        <h4>Stock Price Prediction</h4>
        <p>Import data from Quandl and only store relevent data for our training and then check the data
           for null values and visualize the data to check for
          With the help of processing,scale we tranform the train data.
          Then split the data into train and test data using cross_validation.train_test_split.
             From sklearn.linear_model we import LinearRegression and define out classifier as LinearRegression.
          and use classifier.fit(x) to train the classifier and Classifier.predict to predict for test data.
          And use classifer.score to check the confidence of the model.</p>

        <p>Import data and check the data for null values and visualize the data to check for
           unnecessary data remove if necessary.We then split the data into train and test data.
         Then with the help of MinMax Scaler we fit and tranform the train data and fit it on
        test data. We create a  Sequential Model with certain layers such as Dense layers with relu as
        activation function ,Dropout Layers,then we compile the model with Mean_squared_error as loss function and adam optimizer.
      Then we fit our model using training set and train the model. Then we test it against our test set and check out that our model is
      is efficient or not using classifiaction report and confusion matrix.</p>

        function and adam optimizer also use early callbacks to prevent from overfitting the data.
      Then we fit our model using training set and train the model. Then we test it against our test set and check out that our model is
      is efficient or not using classifiaction report and confusion matrix.</p>
