        as these are the some of the most important tools for todays industry.
        There are many projects that has been completed by me during this journey.
        I started my journey with machine learning and during this i learnt many differnt
        tools such as tensorflow Keras and completed many projects in differnt field of machine
        learning as well as deep learning such as NLP and Computer-Vision.
        After that I countinued my journey with app development with Flutter
        and completed many projects while that journey list of the projects completed by
         me can be found in projects section. After that I started learning web development

         <h3>Deep learning</h3>

         <p class="cl_p">A subset of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) is the area of computational
            science that focuses on analyzing and interpreting patterns and structures in data to enable learning,
            reasoning, and decision making outside of human interaction. Simply put, machine learning allows the
             user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make
             data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data. ML refers to an AI system that
              can self-learn based on the algorithm. Systems that get smarter and smarter over time without human
              intervention is ML. Deep Learning (DL) is a machine learning (ML) applied to large data sets. Most AI
               work involves ML because intelligent behaviour requires considerable knowledge.
            Deep Learning is basically mimicking the human brain, it can also be defined as a multi neural network architecture
             containing a large number of parameters and layers</p>

             and they’re using mobile application platforms to get there. Whether they use mobile phones, tablets or other
              smart mobile devices – they have all the information they need. That’s why mobile apps are so much important
               in today’s business environment.one can use a mobile app for various purposes. For retail business,
                a mobile app can be very helpful for sales. For telecom business, an app can be helpful for
                customer engagement & support. An app can help one's users understand the offerings and benefits more.
                With the transformation of cell phones, the utilization of portable applications is growing at an exponential rate.

            <h3>Web development</h3>
            <p class="cl_p">Website development is a way to make people aware of the services and/or products one is offering,
              understand why one's products are relevant and even necessary for them to buy or use, and see which of the company's
               qualities set it apart from competitors. Displaying this information with high-quality images and thought-out
                presentation  will have a large influence on customers, and it is important to strive towards making your product as
                relatable and appealing as possible.Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet
                (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static
                 page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.
               Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking through forms, filtering output,
                and encryption. It’s the work that happens behind the scenes. </p>
