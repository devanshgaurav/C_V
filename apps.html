        <p>
          Similar to the website we developed this app to select and order the Face Mask.
          Here we used the flutter to develop this app and we have devloped two app
          one is for user end and other is for clint end. Clint end is use to render the
          app data and user end is to order. It has authentication page as well as
          camera api is also used to to allow clint to add photos of mask it is connected to FireBase

        <p>
          This app is fully functional app that shows app the expenses till now and  graph of current-week Expense which we
          implement using Stack function of Flutter. We have a floating button to add new transaction
          which navigate to input form to add the transaction and select the date from date picker.
          We used MediaQuerry so to render the app differntly for Android and IOS.
